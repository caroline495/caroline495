### Hi there üëã
Welcome to my github!

I am interested in combining user and visual design with coding to create enjoyable applications for users. I spent my career thus far in market research, learning about what drives people to make the decisions they do - and after realizing I enjoyed the technical yet creative problem solving involved in coding, I decided to dive into the world of programming to work directly on effective solutions that serve users. 

Some technologies I have experience with:
